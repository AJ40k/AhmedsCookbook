   <h3>Perparation:</h3>
   <p>Step 1: Cut the steak into chunky pieces. Trim off the sinew and any unnecessary fat. Season the beef with salt and pepper.</p>
   <p>Step 2: Add the oil in a pan and fry the cut steak pieces in batches. Fry until all the pieces are golden brown. Transfer to a flameproof casserole pan. Preheat the oven to 165 C.</p>
   <p>Step 2: Fry the bacon bits for 2 to 3 minutes. Scatter the bacon over the meat. Fry the chopped onions in the same pan until softened. Add the garlic and stir for one minute.</p>
   <p>Step 3: Add the garlic and onions to the beef with red wine. Stir in the tomato puree with 150 ml of water. Crush the stock cube and add the herbs, bring to a simmer. Transfer to a oven and cook for one and half hours or until the beef is tender.</p>
   <p>Step 4: Ten minutes before the beef is ready, add the butter and fry the mushrooms until golden brown. Make sure to turn often to avoid burning.</p>
   <p>Step 5: mix cornflour with water until smooth. Remove the casserole pan from the oven and stir in the cornflour mixture, followed by the mushrooms. Return to the oven for 50 minutes until the beef is fall-of tender and the sauce is thick. The sauce should coat the back of a spoon.</p>
   <p>Step 6:When serving, remove the thyme sprigs. add the parsley and serve.</p>
