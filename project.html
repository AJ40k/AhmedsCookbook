    <h3>Establishment of a contract between me and you</h3>
    <p>Before we continue with the recipes we need to have an agreement in place. I have cooked for the majority of my life and there is always one principal rule that I have always followed. Whenever I have cooked, it has more often than not resulted in failure, which just goes to show that even a world renowned chef makes mistakes and you should not feel bad about messing up a dish.</p>

    <h2>Cooking guidelines</h2>
    <h3>1.Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Concerning ingredients, most people think that they should use only the freshest part of each component. While this is true for professional cooking establishments, such as high-end restaurants, it does not apply to home cooking. When cooking at home, cost and availability need to be considered as well as reusability. Purchase whatever falls within your price range and improvise with the rest. </p>
    <h3>2.Preparation</h3>
    <p>Alot of dishes need parts of it to be prepared before-hand, a common example would be pizza. Majority of the recipes instruct you to leave the pizza dough to rest for 1 day. Now if you want to go ahead woth this procedure, you have all the right, but what if you dont have the time. In this scenario, is the pizza not going to be made? No, the pizza will made but you will sacrifice some quality if you dont let the dough rest. My point being that you can bypass some parts of the prepartion cycle by sacrificing quality. </p>
    <h3>3.Liquid addition</h3>
    <p>Recipes revolving around liquid based dishes often tell you to add all the liquid at once, regardless of thickness. This is not true and should be avoided. Cooking is all about adding your own spin to your dishes and concerning adding liquids, you should always add the bare minimum as you can always add more liquid later but you cant remove liquid. </p>
