    <h3>For the beef:</h3>
    <p>Tie the beef in strings so that it holds a cylindrical shape. Cover the in oil, season with salt and pepper and sear the tenderloin in a hot skillet with oil olive. While the beef is searing, arrange the prosciutto in a rectangle on top of a sheet of plastic wrap. Cover the prosciutto in the mixture of mushrooms. Place the seared beef atop the mixture the remove the strings. Smear the beef with dijon mustard and carefully use the plastic wrap to encompass the tenderloin with the porciutto. Tuck in the beef using the prociutto and make sure its completely covered. Use the wrap to close off the ends of the beef and se t it in the fridge to cool and maintain its shape.</p>
    <h3>For the greenpeppercorn sauce:</h3>
    <p>Add olive oil to the pan after removing the beef. Add shallots, thyme and garlic, saute for 3 minutes. Add beef stock and reduce about half. Strain out the solids and add 2 cups of cream and mustard. Reduce about half again and turn off the heat, add the green peppercorns.</p>

Remove the beef from the refrigerator and set it into the center of the pastry and fold the pastry over the beef. Brus the top with egg wash and seal. Cut seams into the top to allow steam to vent. Place this on the baking sheet. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and the beef registers 52 C. Remove from the oven a nd set aside to rest for 30 minutes. Cut into thick slices and serve with the green peppercorn sauce.</p>
